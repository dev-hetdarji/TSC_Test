1- Create a new branch called feature/login. Switch to the new branch.
    - git switch -C feature/login

2- Show all the branches.
    - git branch

3- Update file1.txt in the current branch (feature/login) and make a new commit.
    - git commit -m "Assignment-3 Updated"

4- Show the commits across all branches.
    - git log --oneline --all

5- Switch back to the master branch. Show the commits in the feature branch that don’t exist on master.
    - git switch master
    - git log main..feature/login

6- View the differences between master and feature/login.
    - git diff master..feature/login

7- Merge feature/login into master.
    - git merge feature/login 

8- View the merged and unmerged branches.
    - git branch --merged
    - git branch --no-merged

9- Delete the feature branch.
    - git branch -d feature/login

10- Create a new branch called feature/logout. On this branch, write blue to file1.txt and make a commit.
    - git switch -C feature/logout
    - git commit -am "Blue Added"

Switch back to master, write green to file1.txt and make another commit.
    - git checkout master 
    - git commit -am "Green Added"

Try to merge your feature branch into master. You’ll see a conflict. Resolve the conflict by accepting both changes. When you’re done merging, delete the new branch.
    - git merge feature/logout
    - git branch -d feature/logout

11- Create a new branch called bugfix/login. On this branch, write orange to file1.txt and make a commit.
    - git switch -C "bugfix/login"
    - git commit -am "Orange added"

Switch back to master, write green to file2.txt and make another commit. 
    - git checkout master
    - git commit -am "Green Added"

View a graph of your branches. You’ll see divergence.
    - git log --oneline --all -- graph

Rebase the new branch on top of master.
    - git rebase bugfix/login

View the graph of branches again. Note that the divergence is gone.
    - git log --oneline --all -- graph

Do a fast-forward merge to bring the changes in the bugfix branch into master
    - git switch bugfix/login   
    - git merge main
